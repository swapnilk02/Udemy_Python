# one of the design principle of the python is that it should be uncluttred and easy to read
# unlike other programming language ...python does not use the {}  to enclose the code block ....instead it uses indentation
# to indicate where new code block start
#whenever  a line end with : ,python expect a new code block starting

for i in range(1,13):
    print("No. {} squared is {} and cubed is {:4}".format(i,i**2,i**3))
print("*"*8)  # just add the tab at this line and see the differnce in the code 0
